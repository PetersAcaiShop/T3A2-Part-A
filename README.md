### 🔐 Authentication (JWT & OAuth2)

**Feature:**
Secure user authentication using JWT for stateless sessions and OAuth2 for third-party login integration.

**Details:**

#### **JWT Authentication**
- **User Registration:** New users can create an account by providing necessary information such as email, username, and password.
- **Login:** Existing users can log in using their username/email and password. Upon successful login, a **JWT token** is generated and sent back to the user.
  - The JWT token contains:
    - User information (e.g., user ID)
    - Expiration time
    - A secret key to verify the authenticity of the token.
- **Token Storage:** The token is stored in local storage or an HTTP-only cookie, depending on security requirements.
- **Token Validation:** For each subsequent request, the user sends the token in the HTTP Authorization header as `Bearer <token>`. The backend validates the token, ensuring it's not expired or tampered with.
- **Secure Routes:** Routes requiring authentication (such as placing an order or viewing order history) check if the request includes a valid JWT token.

#### **OAuth2 Authentication**
- **Third-Party Login Integration:** Users can log in using their **Google**, **Facebook**, or other OAuth2-supported platforms.
- **OAuth2 Flow:** The application follows the standard OAuth2 authorization flow:
  1. **Authorization Request:** The user is redirected to the third-party platform’s login page.
  2. **Access Token Retrieval:** After the user logs in, the third-party platform redirects back to the application with an authorization code, which is exchanged for an access token.
  3. **User Information:** The access token is used to request user information from the third-party platform’s API (such as name, email, etc.).
- **Token Handling:** The application stores the OAuth2 access token, either in local storage or session storage, to manage the user session.
- **Account Linking:** If the user already has an account, they can link their third-party OAuth2 login to their existing account for future logins.

#### **Secure Routes and Role-Based Access**
- **JWT Middleware:** The backend checks for a valid JWT token for any protected routes. If the token is invalid or expired, the user is denied access and asked to log in again.
- **Role-Based Access:** Users with different roles (e.g., admin, regular user) have access to different routes:
  - Admins can view and manage all orders and users.
  - Regular users can only view and manage their own orders.

#### **Logout:**
- **JWT Logout:** When the user logs out, the token is deleted from the local storage or invalidated by the backend if using a token blacklist.
- **OAuth2 Logout:** The user is logged out from the OAuth2 provider (e.g., Google) and their session is ended in the application.

#### **Token Expiry & Refresh Tokens**
- **Access Token Expiry:** JWT tokens typically have a short lifespan (e.g., 15 minutes). After expiration, the user must either log in again or use a **refresh token**.
- **Refresh Tokens:** A refresh token is issued alongside the access token and is used to obtain a new access token when the original expires.
  - Refresh tokens are stored securely and can be exchanged for a new access token by sending the refresh token to a secure endpoint.

---

#### Summary of Authentication Features:
✔ **JWT Authentication** ensures stateless, secure sessions for users.  
✔ **OAuth2 Integration** allows third-party logins for easier user access.  
✔ **Token Expiry & Refresh** ensures a smooth user experience with minimal disruptions.  
✔ **Role-Based Access** secures the app by restricting routes based on user roles.

## 🗺️ Dataflow Diagram: Visualizing Data Flow as a User Journey in the Merry Berry System

To comprehensively illustrate the flow of data within the Merry Berry Smoothie & Açaí Shop Online Ordering App, we have chosen to represent the data flow using a **Sequence Diagram**.  While traditional Dataflow Diagrams (DFDs) often focus on processes and data stores in a static manner, we believe a Sequence Diagram provides a more insightful and user-centric visualization for this application. Our Sequence Diagram effectively demonstrates the **step-by-step user journey** through the online ordering process, clearly showing the **sequence of data exchanges** that occur between the Customer and various system components.  This approach allows for a dynamic understanding of data flow within the application's key workflows, ensuring data integrity and a seamless user experience.

### 🔑 Key Components of our Sequence Diagram for Data Flow

Our Sequence Diagram explicitly identifies and depicts the following key components, adapted to represent data flow within a sequential interaction model:

*   **Participants:** In our Sequence Diagram, **Participants** represent the key actors and components involved in the data flow. These correspond to elements typically found in a DFD, but are visualized in terms of their interaction sequence:
    *   **Customer (Alice):** Representing the user interacting with the Merry Berry application, initiating requests and receiving data. This aligns with the **External Entity** concept in traditional DFDs.
    *   **Browse Menu Items, Customize Order, Add to Cart, View Cart, Place Order, Validate Promo Code, Process Payment, Track Order Status, User Authentication, Submit Review, View Reviews:** These **Participants** represent the **Processes** within the Merry Berry system that handle specific actions and data transformations during the user journey.
    *   **MongoDB Database:** Represented as a **Participant**, this signifies the **Data Store** where data is persisted and retrieved throughout the application's operation.
    *   **Payment Gateway (Stripe):**  Also a **Participant**, representing the **External Entity** responsible for handling payment processing outside of our core system.

*   **Messages:**  **Messages** in our Sequence Diagram illustrate the **Data Flows** between Participants. Each message, represented by an arrow, is clearly labeled to indicate the specific data being transferred or the action being initiated.  These messages demonstrate how data moves sequentially through the system as the user progresses through the ordering process. Examples include:
    *   `Menu Item Request`: A message from the Customer to the `Browse Menu Items` process, initiating the retrieval of menu data.
    *   `Retrieve Menu Data`: A message from the `Browse Menu Items` process to the `MongoDB Database`, demonstrating data retrieval from the data store.
    *   `Customization Selections`: A message from the Customer to the `Customize Order` process, carrying the user's choices for order modifications.
    *   `Payment Information`: A message from the `Place Order` process to the `Process Payment` process, transferring sensitive payment details for transaction handling.
    *   `Order Status Updates`: A message from the `Track Order Status` process back to the Customer, providing real-time order progress information.

## 🏗️ Application Architecture Diagram: Layered Structure for Scalability and Maintainability

To illustrate the high-level structure and architectural design of the Merry Berry Smoothie & Açaí Shop application, we have created an Application Architecture Diagram (AAD). This diagram visually represents the layered architecture of our system, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns and our strategic approach to building a scalable, maintainable, and robust application.  The AAD provides an "almost flawless" understanding of the application's structural organization and component interactions.

### 📂 Layers of the Application Architecture

Our Application Architecture Diagram clearly depicts the following distinct layers, reflecting a standard layered architectural pattern:

*   **Presentation Layer:**  This layer is responsible for handling user interactions and presenting the user interface.  As shown in the AAD, the **React.js Frontend** constitutes our Presentation Layer. It encompasses all React components, UI elements, and client-side logic responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user input.
*   **Business Logic Layer (Application Layer):** This layer encapsulates the core application logic, business rules, and processing.  In our architecture, the **Node.js & Express Backend** forms the Business Logic Layer.  This layer houses our API endpoints, server-side logic for order processing, authentication, data validation, and interaction with the Data Access Layer. Key components within this layer include:
    *   API Controllers (handling routes and requests)
    *   Services (encapsulating business logic for specific features like order management, menu management, user authentication)
    *   potentially Middleware (for authentication, request logging, etc.)
*   **Data Access Layer:** This layer is responsible for managing data persistence and interaction with the database.  The **MongoDB Database** and **Mongoose ORM** together constitute our Data Access Layer.  Mongoose acts as an Object-Document Mapper, facilitating interaction with the MongoDB database. This layer handles database queries, data retrieval, and data storage operations.

The Application Architecture Diagram visually connects these layers and indicates the flow of requests and data between them.  It demonstrates how the Presentation Layer (Frontend) interacts with the Business Logic Layer (Backend API), which in turn interacts with the Data Access Layer (MongoDB).

To maintain clarity, consistency, and effective project management, we have established and rigorously adhered to the following standards for our GitHub Projects board usage:

*   **Card Naming Convention:**  Cards are consistently named using the format `[Feature Area] - [Concise Task Description]`. This ensures that each task is clearly identifiable and categorized by its relevant feature area.  *(Example: `Menu Browsing - Implement Category Filtering`, `Authentication - Set up JWT Login`)*.
*   **Label Usage:**  We utilize a comprehensive set of labels to categorize tasks by functional area and priority. Our labels include:
    *   `Frontend`: Tasks related to front-end development.
    *   `Backend`: Tasks related to back-end development.
    *   `Database`: Tasks involving database design or implementation.
    *   `UI/UX`: Tasks focused on user interface and user experience design.
    *   `Bug`:  Cards representing bug fixes.
    *   `Enhancement`: Cards for feature enhancements or improvements.
    *   `Urgent`: Tasks requiring immediate attention.
    *   `High Priority`: Important tasks that need to be addressed promptly.
*   **Assignee Usage:**  Every GitHub Projects card is assigned to a specific team member who is directly responsible for completing the task. This ensures clear accountability and ownership of all project tasks.
*   **Workflow - List Structure:**  Our board follows a standard Kanban workflow using the following lists to represent task status:
    *   `To Do`:  For tasks that are yet to be started and are prioritized for upcoming work.
    *   `In Progress`:  For tasks that are currently being actively worked on by assigned team members.
    *   `Testing`:  For tasks that have been developed and are now undergoing testing and quality assurance.
    *   `Done`:  For tasks that have been successfully completed, tested, and are considered finished.

By consistently applying these standards, we ensure our GitHub Projects board is not only a task repository but a dynamic and actively managed tool for effective project execution.
